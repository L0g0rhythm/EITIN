1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Windows 8 or later (including Windows Server 2012 or newer).
    *   PowerShell enabled.
    *   Administrative permissions to run the script.
    *   PowerShell execution policy configured to allow the use of the `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` parameter. (It is recommended to adjust the policy to a more secure level after execution, if necessary.)

2.  **Steps:**
    *   Clone the repository or download the `Get-SystemInfo.ps1` file directly.
    *   Run the PowerShell script (`Get-SystemInfo.ps1`) with elevated privileges (Run as Administrator). You can do this by right-clicking the file and selecting "Run as administrator".
    *   **Report Generation:** The report will be automatically created and saved on the current user's Desktop in the following format:
        ```
        Inventory_ddMMyyyy_HHmmss.txt
        ```
        **Example:**
