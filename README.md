IT Inventory with Privilege Elevation
This repository contains a PowerShell script (.ps1) and a Batch file (.bat) that, together, automate the collection of detailed system information for IT inventory purposes. The goal is to facilitate asset management, ensuring the report is generated with elevated privileges and output in Brazilian Portuguese.

üìã Overview
PowerShell Script (run_as_admin.ps1):
Collects system data, including:

Windows Specifications: Name, version, build, installation date, and last boot time;
Hardware Information: CPU, RAM, disks, and device type (Desktop or Laptop);
Network: Status of active network adapters, MAC addresses (differentiating Wi-Fi and Ethernet interfaces), and primary IP;
Software and Updates: List of installed software (excluding Microsoft products) and history of the last 10 Windows updates, categorized as quality updates, drivers, definitions, and others;
Others: Information about BIOS, firmware, monitors, and Active Directory data when available.
Batch File (run_as_admin.bat):
Acts as a launcher to start the PowerShell script with elevated privileges (Run as Administrator), ensuring full access to system information.
