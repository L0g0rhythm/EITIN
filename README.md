# EITIN - Elevated IT Inventory

This repository contains a PowerShell script (`run_as_admin.ps1`) that automates the collection of detailed system information for IT inventory purposes. The goal is to streamline asset management by ensuring that the report is generated with elevated privileges.

### üìã Overview

The PowerShell script collects a comprehensive set of system data, including:

- **Windows Specifications**: Name, version, build, installation date, and last boot time.
- **Hardware Information**: CPU, RAM, disks, device type (Desktop or Laptop).
- **Network**: Status of active network adapters, MAC addresses (Wi-Fi and Ethernet interfaces), and main IP address.
- **Software and Updates**: List of installed software (excluding Microsoft products) and the history of the last 10 Windows updates, categorized into quality updates, drivers, definitions, and others.
- **Others**: Information about BIOS, firmware, monitors, and Active Directory data (if available).
- **Graphics Card**: Information about the installed graphics card.
- **Firewall Status**: Firewall status check.
- **Antivirus**: Windows Defender and other installed antivirus status.
- **Activation Status**: Checks if Windows is activated.

### üöÄ How to Use

**Prerequisites**:

- **Operating System**: Windows 7 or later (including Windows Server 2012 or later versions).
- **PowerShell**: Version 2 or higher (recommended).
- **Administrative Permissions**: Required to run the script (in case of failure).
- **PowerShell Execution Policy**: Ensure the execution policy allows the use of `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`. After running, it is recommended to adjust the policy to a more secure level.  (e.g., `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`)

**Steps**:

1. Clone the repository or download the folder directly from GitHub.
2. Run the `run_as_admin.bat` file (elevated privileges are automatic). Alternatively, right-click on the script file and select **Run as Administrator**.
3. **Report Generation**: The report will be automatically generated and saved on the current user's desktop in the following format:

   `Inventory_ddMMyyyy_HHmmss.txt`

   Example:

   `C:\Users\YourUser\Desktop\Inventory_04022025_153045.txt`
