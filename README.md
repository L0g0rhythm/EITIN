## 🌎 Overview

**EITIN (Elevated IT Inventory)** is a PowerShell automation suite designed to perform a comprehensive, professional-grade IT inventory. Originally a monolithic script, the project has been completely refactored into a modular, robust, and highly extensible architecture.

Its main goal is to provide detailed, accurate, and visually elegant reports in multiple formats (Interactive HTML, Print/PDF-Optimized HTML, and CSV), ensuring portability and ease of use in diverse IT environments. The tool is self-sufficient and designed to run with minimal dependencies, featuring a self-elevation mechanism to ensure complete data collection.

## ✨ Key Features

### Architecture and Execution

- **Complete Modularization:** The project is divided into `Core` (central functions), `Modules` (data collection scripts), `Config` (execution control), and `Assets` (style resources), ensuring high maintainability.
- **Control via `config.json`:** Allows enabling or disabling the collection of specific inventory sections without changing a single line of code, offering maximum flexibility.
- **Self-Elevation of Privileges:** The main script detects if it is being run as an Administrator and, if not, requests elevation via UAC to ensure complete data collection.
- **Full Portability:** Designed to be run from any location, such as a flash drive, without requiring installation.
- **Assured Compatibility:** Standardized encoding (`UTF-8 with BOM` for `.ps1`, `ANSI` for `.bat`) to ensure correct display of characters in PowerShell 5.1 and higher.

### Multi-Format Report Generation

- **Premium Interactive HTML Report:**
  - **"Liquid Glass" Visual:** A modern, translucent design that simulates floating glass panels.
  - **Intelligent Navigation:** Sidebar with smooth scrolling, highlighting of the active section, and elegant animations.
  - **Robust and Responsive Layout:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes without breaking or visual "jumps".
  - **Scrollable Containers:** Sections with a large amount of data (like Installed Software, Updates, and Network) have elegant, internally scrolling boxes to avoid cluttering the view.
  - **Self-Sufficient File:** The generated HTML contains all the necessary CSS and JavaScript embedded, making it 100% portable.
- **PDF-Optimized HTML Report:**
  - A second HTML file is generated with a clean, vertical "flat" design, optimized for the A4 format.
  - Ideal for use with the browser's "Print > Save as PDF" function, generating a professional and perfectly formatted document.
- **Complete CSV Reports:**
  - Generates a `.csv` file for **each section** of the inventory.
  - Tabular data is exported directly, and simple key-value data is transformed into two-column tables, ensuring **no information is lost** and facilitating analysis in spreadsheets.
- **Traditional TXT Report:**
  - Maintains the generation of a simple text report with consistent and highly readable formatting, ideal for quick viewing in terminals.
- **Organized Naming Convention:** All reports are saved in a `Logs/COMPUTER_NAME/USER_NAME/` folder structure with standardized file names for easy identification.

### Comprehensive Data Collection

- **Identification:** Computer name, logged-in users, etc.
- **Operating System:** Edition, version, build, installation date.
- **Hardware:** Equipment type, Processor (CPU), RAM (per module), Graphics Cards (GPU), Storage (Physical Disks and Volumes), Monitors, and Peripherals.
- **Network:** Details of all active network adapters, including IP addresses, MAC, and speed.
- **Software:** Third-party installed software, Microsoft Office licenses, and Windows activation status.
- **Security:** Firewall status, Antivirus status, and a security compliance summary (BitLocker, UAC, etc.).
- **Updates:** History of the last 15 installed Windows updates.

## 🚀 Usage

The simplest and recommended way to run the tool:

1.  Navigate to the `EITIN` folder.
2.  Double-click the **`EITIN.bat`** file.
3.  A UAC (User Account Control) prompt will appear requesting elevation. **Accept** it to continue.
4.  A PowerShell window will open, and the inventory collection will begin.
5.  Upon completion, the console will display the paths to all generated reports.

## 📊 Generated Reports

All reports are saved in the `Logs\[COMPUTER_NAME]\[USER_NAME]\` folder.

- **`[COMPUTER_NAME]_[USER_NAME].txt`**: Plain text report.
- **`[COMPUTER_NAME]_[USER_NAME]_Interactive.html`**: Interactive report with the "Liquid Glass" design.
- **`[COMPUTER_NAME]_[USER_NAME]_Printable.html`**: Report optimized for printing and PDF conversion.
